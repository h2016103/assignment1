Follow the following Steps:

1. First change the permission of cpuinfo_cur_freq file.
   Type sudo chmod 777 /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq in the terminal.
2. Go to the directory containing files ("main.c","user.c","Makefile") and type "make all" in the terminal.Ignore any warning related to       "implict function declaration".
3. Insert module into the kernel  "sudo insmod main.ko".
4. To generate the random number type "sudo ./a.out".
5. Enter the range and random number will be generated.
6. Use "make clean" to perform cleanup action.

##DESCRIPTION:
This module uses the current CPU frequency to generate a random number. To read the current CPU frequency we have to read the LOG file "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq" present in the user space.Now to read a user space file from the kernel space change the file segment using function "set_fs(get_ds)", then use __vfsread (virtual file system read) to read the CPU frequency data.
